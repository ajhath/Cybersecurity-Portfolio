# Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

### Overview
This document provides an analysis of network traffic using Wireshark to identify potential malicious activity. The capture contains HTTP requests, DNS queries, and TCP connections that are suspicious.

### Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Network capture file (.pcap)

### Methodology
1. Opened the `.pcap` file in Wireshark.
2. Applied filters to identify HTTP traffic (`http` filter) and DNS requests (`dns` filter).
3. Analyzed anomalies in TCP connections using the `tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0` filter to detect SYN flooding attempts.

### Findings
- **Suspicious DNS Query**: A DNS query for a suspicious domain `malicious-site.com` was detected.
- **Unusual HTTP Request**: Multiple HTTP requests for an admin page from unauthorized IP addresses.
- **SYN Flood**: Numerous SYN packets were detected without corresponding ACK packets, indicating a possible SYN flood attack.

### Conclusion
The analysis confirms malicious traffic, including potential DNS tunneling and a SYN flood attack.
